# gitPractice
Writing a simple program with hidden malicious code in the background, scraping victim's folders and sending information back to main computer. Goal: practice Git commands in a collaborative fashion.

malware subsections:
- scrape victim's files and folders (Desktop/Documents/Downloads), and look for files with the word "bank" in it. If however we find a folder with the word "bank" in it, then we check all files within the folder, regarless of naming.
- Send file to attacker's computer. If file is password protected, unencrypt it first, save in new file, and send that unencrpyted file. 

things to practice:
git squash
git revert (go back in commits)
git branch

next step:
- create new branch
- work on it
- try many small commits small changes
- attempt to squash
- make a pull request
- if accepted, merge
